    <p class="lead" >1. Pack less</p>
        Travelling with just hand-luggage should be your goal.
        Do you really need six pairs of heels, tea bags, and an iron?
        Take less and you’ll travel cheaper (no check-in luggage fees),
        travel faster (no waiting for your bags), and travel easier
        (one bag means less to lug around).
    <p class="lead" style="margin-top: 30px">2. Leave the guidebook at home</p>
        Rather than taking your entire copy of the Rough Guide or Lonely Planet,
        just photocopy the pages you need, then discard after you have used them.
        Saves space and weight.
    <p class="lead" style="margin-top: 30px">3. Never wear flip flops (on a plane)</p>
        I used to work for an airline and we were told never to wear sandals on board an aircraft.
        In the unlikely event of an emergency, it’s best to have a good set of sturdy shoes that will
        protect your feet from heat or sharp objects.
